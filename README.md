Various solutions for code tests that I have taken.

The first few of these were a series of challenges for a company in the Denver area - they were looking for mid and above people

The first was to select the middle one or two characters in a string.
The second was add the numbers in an array, unless they were evenly divisuble by 3 or 5.
Third up was a markdown parser - to get the markdown header levels into HTML.
Fourth, masking strings, such as a credit card or email address
Fifth, was a fun one - finding triangular numbers
And last, a Roman numeral conversion.

All of these need tests added - the system ran tests, so I didn't have access to many of them.
